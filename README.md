  <h2>Introduction</h2>
PC Assemble is one of the lab work in the course SECP1513 Technology & Information Systems. On the 2nd of November 2023, I carried out a lab work, which is PC Assemble at the N28. During the session, students are assigned to several groups and each group is assisted by a lab assistant. Reassembling the PC was done in accordance with the instructions provided by the lecturer, Dr. Iqbal Tariq. Besides, the PC assemble process involved assembling the motherboard, CPU, and other components to create a functional PC.
